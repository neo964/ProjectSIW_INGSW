1	The 100	Sci-Fi	Jason Rothenberg	2014	f	5	https://www.youtube.com/embed/ia1Fbg96vL0	The series is set 97 years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wiped out almost all life on Earth. Over 2,400 survivors live on a single massive station in Earth is orbit called "The Ark". After the Ark is life-support systems are found to be failing, 100 juvenile prisoners are sent to the surface in a last attempt to determine whether Earth is habitable. They discover not all humanity was destroyed and some survived the apocalypse: the Grounders, who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the Reapers, another group of Grounders who have become cannibals; and Mountain Men, who live in Mount Weather and locked themselves away before the apocalypse.\n\nIn the second season, the remaining 48 of the 100 are captured and taken to Mount Weather by the Mountain Men. It is eventually revealed that the Mountain Men are transfusing blood from imprisoned Grounders as an anti-radiation treatment. Medical tests of the 100 show an even more potent anti-radiation efficacy; their bone marrow will allow the mountain men to survive outside containment. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the Ark have successfully crash-landed various stations on Earth and begun an alliance with the Grounders to save groups of people, naming the main settlement at Alpha Station "Camp Jaha".\n\nIn the third season, Camp Jaha, now renamed "Arkadia", comes under new management when Pike, a former teacher and mentor, is elected as chancellor and begins a war with the Grounders. An artificial intelligence named A.L.I.E. was commanded to make life better for mankind and responded by solving the problem of human overpopulation by launching a nuclear apocalypse that devastated Earth. The AI takes over the minds of nearly everyone in Arkadia and Polis, the capital city of the Grounders. In the season three finale, Clarke manages to destroy A.L.I.E.\n\nIn the fourth season, hundreds of nuclear reactors around the world are melting down due to decades of neglect that will result in 96% of the planet becoming uninhabitable. Clarke and the others investigate ways to survive the coming wave of radiation. When it is discovered that Nightbloods, descendants of first, original Nightbloods, including Becca, the first grounder Commander and creator of A.L.I.E., can metabolize radiation, Clarke and the others attempt to recreate the formula, but their attempts failed. An old bunker is discovered that can protect 1,200 people for over 5 years; each of the twelve clans select a hundred people to stay in the bunker. A small group decides to return to space and survive in the remnants of the original Ark.	9.99000000000000021	images/tv/The100.jpg
